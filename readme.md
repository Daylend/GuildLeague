   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guild-league-team-maker.git
   cd guild-league-team-maker
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Discord bot token:

### Docker Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guild-league-team-maker.git
   cd guild-league-team-maker
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Discord bot token:
   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ```

3. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

### Adding the Bot to Your Server

1. Create a Discord application and bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Enable necessary intents (Message Content, Reactions, and Server Members)
3. Generate an invite URL with the proper permissions
4. Invite the bot to your server

### Setting Up Team Selection

1. Use `/register` in a channel to create a registration embed
2. Have users react with âœ… to join the participant pool
3. When ready, use `/choose [number]` to select team members
4. Optional parameters:
   - `mention=True` to automatically mention selected users
   - `included_members="@User1 @User2"` to always include specific members

## Commands

| Command | Description | Parameters |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/register` | Creates a registration embed for users to join | None |
| `/choose` | Selects random participants from the registration list | `number`: Number of participants to choose<br>`mention`: Whether to mention selected users<br>`included_members`: Members to always include |
| `/add` | Manually adds a user to the participant list | `member`: The Discord member to add |
| `/delete` | Removes a user from the participant list | `member`: The Discord member to remove |
| `/help` | Displays help information | `visible`: Whether to make response visible to everyone |

## Command Examples

- Create a registration embed:
  ```
  /register
  ```

- Select 5 random participants:
  ```
  /choose number:5
  ```

- Select 10 participants, including specific members:
  ```
  /choose number:10 included_members:"@User1 @User2"
  ```

- Select 8 participants and mention them:
  ```
  /choose number:8 mention:True
  ```

## How It Works

The bot maintains a list of participants for each channel, tracking who has been selected previously. When choosing team members:

1. It first includes any specified mandatory members
2. It then selects random participants who haven't been chosen yet
3. If more members are needed than are available, it resets everyone's selection status and continues selection
4. This ensures a fair rotation of participants over multiple team selections
